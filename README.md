# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how historical airline flight data can be effectively analyzed to understand and predict flight delays using regression techniques. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building, key factors influencing delays—such as departure timing, distance, and airline characteristics—were identified.

The regression model provided meaningful insights and achieved satisfactory performance in predicting delay durations. This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and feature selection in improving model accuracy. Overall, the analysis can help airlines and passengers better anticipate delays and make informed decisions.

With further enhancements such as incorporating weather data and advanced machine learning models, the prediction accuracy can be significantly improved, making this system more robust and practical for real-world applications.
